## Hi! I'm Mahnoor. ðŸ˜Š


I am currently a final year Computer Science student at COMSATS University Islamabd, eager to embark on my professional journey. 

I fell in love with software not too long ago; something about the 1s and 0s of it all fascinated me back in 2017, and I have never looked back since. I am still trying to find my niche in this glorious world of computer science - playing around with different languages and tools to find my place. I have always been interested in delving into the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. So maybe I'll start there for now. ðŸ’»
